<p class="message">
  My name is Bernard Munslow and I do web development for life and for fun.  Read on!
</p>

My professional career as a web developer began in 2007.  Ever since, the most valuable skill I have acquired is *learning to learn*. I also have a keen eye on detail and I like getting things done well and on time.

Over the years I have had the privilege of building and maintaining all sorts of web projects and services with a wide array of open source tools and technologies, including [Drupal](http://www.drupal.org), [Prestashop](http://www.prestashop.com), [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/), custom PHP frameworks and many others.

Drupal merits a special place in my portfolio, since I have been working with it for a number of years.  I have now become a full-fledged **Drupal developer** and I tackle the three major disciplines in Drupal development: backend, frontend and site building.  Feel free to check out my [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/u/bmunslow) profile!

Where do we go from here?

I'm ready to keep improving, face new challenges and most importantly *keep learning*.

Thanks for reading!
